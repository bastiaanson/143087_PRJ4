                Handball is a team sport in which two teams of seven players
                each (six out court players and a goalkeeper) pass a ball using
                their hands with the aim of throwing it into the goal of the
                other team. A standard match consists of two periods of 30
                minutes, and the team that scores more goals wins. Modern
                handball is played on a court of 40 by 20 meters , with a goal
                in the middle of each end. The goals are surrounded by a 6-meter
                zone where only the defending goalkeeper is allowed; goals must
                be scored by throwing the ball from outside the zone or while
                "diving" into it. The sport is usually played indoors, but
                outdoor variants exist in the forms of field handball, Czech
                handball (which were more common in the past) and beach
                handball. The game is fast and high scoring: professional teams
                now typically score between 20 and 35 goals each, though lower
                scores were not uncommon until a few decades ago. Body contact
                is permitted for the defenders trying to stop the attackers from
                approaching the goal. No protective equipment is mandated, but
                players may wear soft protective bands, pads, and mouth guards.

                The game was codified at the end of the 19th century in Denmark.
                The modern set of rules was published in 1917 by Karl Schelenz,
                Max Heiser, and Erich Konigh, on 29 October in Berlin, which day
                is seen as the date of birth of the sport. The rules have had
                several revisions since. The first official handball match was
                played in 1917 in Germany.
