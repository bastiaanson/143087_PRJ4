                Volleyball is a team sport in which two teams of six players are
                separated by a net. Each team tries to score points by grounding
                a ball on the other team's court under organized rules. It has
                been a part of the official program of the Summer Olympic Games
                since Tokyo 1964. The complete set of rules is extensive but
                play essentially proceeds as follows: a player on one of the
                teams begins a 'rally' by serving the ball (tossing or releasing
                it and then hitting it with a hand or arm), from behind the back
                boundary line of the court, over the net, and into the receiving
                team's court. The receiving team must not let the ball be
                grounded within their court. The team may touch the ball up to
                three times to return the ball to the other side of the court,
                but individual players may not touch the ball twice
                consecutively. Typically, the first two touches are used to set
                up for an attack. An attack is an attempt to direct the ball
                back over the net in such a way that the team receiving the ball
                is unable to pass the ball and continue the rally, thus, losing
                the point. The team that wins the rally is awarded a point and
                serves the ball to start the next rally. A few of the most
                common faults include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    causing the ball to touch the ground or floor outside the
                    opponents' court or without first passing over the net.
                </li>
                <li>catching and throwing the ball.</li>
                <li>
                    double hit: two consecutive contacts with the ball made by
                    the same player.
                </li>
                <li>
                    four consecutive contacts with the ball made by the same
                    team.
                </li>
                <li>net foul: touching the net during play.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The ball is usually played with the hands or arms, but players
                can legally strike or push (short contact) the ball with any
                part of the body.

                A number of consistent techniques have evolved in volleyball,
                including spiking and blocking (because these plays are made
                above the top of the net, the vertical jump is an athletic skill
                emphasized in the sport) as well as passing, setting, and
                specialized player positions and offensive and defensive
                structures.
